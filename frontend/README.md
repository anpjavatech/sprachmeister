# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Quick Start with Vite

This guide will help you quickly set up a project using Vite, a fast frontend build tool.

### Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

To install Vite globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g create-vite@latest
```

### Creating a Project

To create a new Vite project, execute the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

When prompted, select JavaScript as your project template.

### Getting Started

After creating your project, navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd <project_space>
```

Next, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch a local development server. You can now start coding and see your changes in real-time.
